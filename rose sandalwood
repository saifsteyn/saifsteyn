<u><b>uses of rose sandalwood</u></b>
<pre class="two">
1.Sandalwood oil has a distinctive soft, warm, smooth, creamy, and milky precious-wood scent.
2.It imparts a long-lasting, woody base to perfumes from the oriental, woody, fougère, and chypre families, as well as a fixative to floral and citrus fragrances. 
3.Sandalwood is also a key ingredient in the "floriental" (floral-ambery) fragrance family – when combined with white florals such as jasmine, ylang ylang, gardenia, plumeria, orange blossom, tuberose, etc.
4.Sandalwood oil in India is widely used in the cosmetic industry. The main source of true sandalwood, S. album, is a protected species, and demand for it cannot be met. Many species of plants are traded as "sandalwood".
5.The genus Santalum has more than 19 species.  
6.Isobornyl cyclohexanol is a synthetic fragrance chemical produced as an alternative to the natural product.
7.sandalwood's main components are the two isomers of santalol (about 75%). It is used in aromatherapy and to prepare soaps.
8.Due to its low fluorescence and optimal refractive index, sandalwood oil is often employed as an immersion oil within ultraviolet and fluorescence microscopy.<br>

<u><b>Religion reference:</u></b>
<pre class="two">
1.Indian sandalwood is very sacred in the Hindu Ayurveda and is known in Sanskrit as chandana.
2.The wood is used for worshipping the god Shiva, and it is believed that goddess Lakshmi lives in the sandalwood tree.

      <u><b>Pests and diseases</u></b>
      <pre class="two">
1.Spike disease is one of the important diseases of sandal. 
2.This disease is caused by mycoplasma-like organisms (MLO). It can occur at any stage of development of the tree.
3.As the disease progresses, the new leaves become smaller, narrower or more pointed and fewer in number with each successive year until the new shoots give an appearance of fine spike.
4.At the advance stage of disease the inter nodal distance on twigs becomes small, haustorial connection between the host and sandal breaks and the plant dies in about 2 to 3 years.
5.Spread of disease is sporadic and the disease is transmitted in nature by insect vectors. It has been found that other insect vectors in addition to Nephotettix virescens may also be responsible for transmission of disease. So far no permanent remedial measures have been prescribed for control of spike disease.
6.Stem borers Zeuzera coffease Nietn (red borer) Indarbela quardinotata Walker (bark-feeding caterpillar) and Aristobia octofasiculata Aurivillius (heartwood borer) are some of the pests causing considerable damage to living trees.<br>
