    <u><b> description:</u></b>
    
Thuja occidentalis, also known as northern white cedar, eastern white cedar, or arborvitae, is an evergreen coniferous tree.
It belongs to the cypress family Cupressaceae, which is native to eastern Canada and much of the northcentral and northeastern United States.

2.It is widely cultivated as ornamental plant.

3. Additional common names include swamp cedar,[3] American arborvitae,[4] and eastern arborvitae.[4] The name arborvitae is particularly used in the horticultural trade in the United States. It is Latin for "tree of life" - due to the supposed medicinal properties of the sap, bark, and twigs.[6] It is sometimes called white-cedar (hyphenated) or whitecedar (one word)[4] to distinguish it from Cedrus, a distantly related genus of trees also known as cedars.[7]
4. Unlike the closely related western red cedar (Thuja plicata), northern white cedar is only a small or medium-sized tree, growing to a height of 15 m tall.

5. The seed cones are slender, yellow-green, ripening to brown. The branches may take root if the tree falls.
 
6. Thuja contains chemicals that might fight viruses. It also contains a chemical called thujone that can cause brain problems.
 
7. Thuja occidentalis is widely used in homeopathy and evidence-based phytotherapy.

<u><b>HEALTH BENEFITS:</u></b>
<pre class="two">
1.Thuja is a tree. The leaves and leaf oil are used as a medicine.
2.Thuja is used for respiratory tract infections such as bronchitis, bacterial skin infections, and cold sores.
3.It is also used for painful conditions including osteoarthritis and a nerve disorder that affects the face called trigeminal neuralgia.
4.Some people use thuja to loosen phlegm (as an expectorant), to boost the immune system (as an immunostimulant), and to increase urine flow (as a diuretic). It has also been used to cause abortions.
5.Thuja is sometimes applied directly to the skin for joint pain, ostearthritis, and muscle pain. Thuja oil is also used for skin diseases, warts, and cancer; and as an insect repellent.
•	Cold sores. Early research suggests that taking a specific product containing vitamin C and extracts of thuja, echinacea, and wild indigo (Esberitox) by mouth reduces itchiness, tension, and pain people with cold sores.
•	Low white blood cell count (leukopenia). Early research suggests that taking a specific product containing vitamin C and extracts of thuja, echinacea, and wild indigo (Esberitox N) by mouth in improves white blood cell counts in people with low numbers of white blood cells after having received chemotherapy for 6 months or less. However, it does not seem to improve white blood cell counts in people who received chemotherapy for longer time periods. Also, other research suggests that Esberitox N does not improve white blood cell counts when used by women receiving radiation treatment.
•	Nasal swelling (sinusitis). Early research suggests that taking a specific product containing vitamin C and extracts of thuja, echinacea, and wild indigo (Esberitox) by mouth for 20 days improves nasal blockage and general well-being in people with sinusitis who are also taking antibiotics.
•	Sore throat (tonsillitis). Early research suggests that taking a specific product containing vitamin C and extracts of thuja, echinacea, and wild indigo (Esberitox) by mouth for 2 weeks, along with the antibioticdrug erythromycin, reduces symptoms and improves well-being and recovery in people with tonsillitis better than taking erythromycin alone.
•	Stimulating immune function.
•	Bronchitis.
•	Pneumonia.
•	Skin infections.
•	Nerve pain.
•	Strep throat.
•	Abortions.
•	Arthritis.
•	Joint pain.
•	Muscle aches.
•	Skin diseases.
•	Cancer.
•	Warts.
•	Use as an insect repellent.
•	Other conditions.

<u><b>SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS AND WARNINGS</u></b>
<pre class="two">
 Special Precautions & Warnings:

1.Pregnancy and breast-feeding: It's LIKELY UNSAFE to take thuja by mouth if you are pregnant.
2.Thuja might cause a miscarriage.
3.It is also LIKELY UNSAFE to take thuja by mouth if you are breast-feeding because of possible toxicity. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
4.“Auto-immune diseases” such as multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or other conditions: Thuja might cause the immune system to become more active, and this could increase the symptoms of auto-immune diseases. If you have one of these conditions, it's best to avoid using thuja.
5.Seizures: Taking thuja might cause seizures in some people. Don't take thuja if you have a history of having seizures.

<u><b>SPLEEN CELL PLORIFICATION</u></b>
<pre class="two">

Spleen Cell Proliferation
The Thuja retentate fraction (obtained by dialysis of an aqueous-ethanolic extract of Thuja occ cut-off: 10 000 Dan, Amicon SP20, S10Y10) caused an increase in the proliferation rates of spleen cells from NMRI and C3H/HeJ mice. In comparison with the medium control, a significantly higher incorporation rate was found up to a concentration of 7.8 μg/ml. The maximum stimulation indices were 5.3 in the tests with spleen cells from NMRI mice. In the tests with C3H/HeJ spleen cells, stimulation index (SImax) values of 3.4 were reached (38).
</pre>
<u><b>SIDE EFFECTS</u></b>
<pre class="two">
SIDE EFFECTS:
When taken by mouth: Thuja is LIKELY SAFE when products that are thujone-free are taken in food amounts. But it is POSSIBLY UNSAFE to take thuja in the larger amounts found in medicine. Large doses of thuja can cause queasiness, vomiting, diarrhea, seizures, and death.

When applied to the skin: There isn't enough reliable information to know if thuja is safe or what the side effects might be.
